#### If you go to a unknown path, you are going to see a *Page Not Found*.
#### The FakeAPI in the archive *db.json* have the information about three events (you can aggregate more using the nomenclature).
#### You can add a rank for one event if you put a valid ticket identifier and a valid ranking (1, 2, 3, 4 or 5).
